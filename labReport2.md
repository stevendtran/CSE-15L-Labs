# Week 4 - Lab Report 2

This is the picture of the changes of the code where my group and I fixed three errors.  
![Picture]screenshotThree.png  

The three errors that we were trying to solve with the three fixes that we made to the code was: 
* Pictures being mistakened for website links. [Picture Test File]threeTest/Picture.md
* New line causing a infinite loop. [NewLine Test File]threeTest/NewLineError.md
* Empty file or a file with no links. [Empty Test File]threeTest/Empty.md

## Picture 
The picture was causing problems for the code because it had the same format as putting a link in a markdown file ([]link) the only differnce between the two is that the format for a picture you inlucde the ! at the beginning (![]picture).
