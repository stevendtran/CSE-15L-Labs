## Streamlining ssh Configuration
1. I was using a windows machine so I manually went into the .ssh file in the user to make the config file. Then I copied and pasted the user and hostname into the config file.

2. With that I no longer had to type in the hostname and username instead I used the alias ieng6.

3. I used the `cp` command to copy a file from my local desktop to the ieng6 server.
