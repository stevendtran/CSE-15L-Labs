This is the [link](https://github.com/stevendtran/NewMarkdown) to my markdown parser.  
This is the [link](https://github.com/aejiang/markdown-parser) to the markdown parser that my group and I reviewed.   

## Results

This is the result of using my code on Snippit 1, Snippit 2, and Snippit 3.

All of the test failed for Snippit 1-3 because of various reasons. One of the reasons being that I coded so everytime the code runs into something that causes problems, it breaks the loop.   

This is the result of the using the other group's code that we reviewed on Snippit 1, Snippit 2, and Snippit 3.

All of the test failed for Snippit 1-3 also failed the test.
